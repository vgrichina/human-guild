# human-guild

Our mission is to increase the number of people earning crypto every day. 

Bitcoin sparked the greatest wealth creation event of our generation since the Internet. Ethereum ignited a revolution in computing, turning “application-specific Bitcoin” into a general-purpose computing platform. In 2021 we are moving from a stage where people are mainly buying and selling digital assets to a stage where more people are using blockchain-powered apps to participate in economy.

The Human Guild’s purpose is to lower the barrier to entry for people looking to turn their work or hobbies into new ways to earn income. Thousands of people have already become financially independent through the Web3 ecosystem. We want to provide the next billion people with new tools to generate income.
