The system is rigged. From Facebook to Robinhood the message is consistent. You are the product.

Facebook is happy to burn your family relationships to make a fortune on political ads. Happy with your zero fee trading on Robinhood? Wall Street is paying them to get access to the “suckers”. And if suckers win – guess who is disabling the “Buy” button?

It’s time to take the power back. Let the establishment taste the free market that they preach but never enable.

You deserve to own what you do online. It’s your right to create what your audience wants and get paid for it. Same as it’s your right to outplay Wall Street in their game. Corporate gatekeepers shouldn’t hold your living hostage.

We have to take back our freedom. Let’s build a new world together.

## Our values

_TODO: experiment with wording_

### Do-ocracy
If you want something done, do it, but remember to be excellent to each other when doing so. You aren’t allowed to ask for permission. Take responsibility instead.

### Skin in the game
If you want your opinion taken seriously you need to have skin in the game. Do the work, hold a token, use an app.

### Relentlessly resourceful
We don’t know what works but we won’t stop trying. We embrace diversity in our movement to find what works together.

### Pragmatism
Capitalism isn't an ideal economic system. Blockchain isn’t ideal tech. We use what we realistically have in our disposal right now to help people take back power.


## What can I do to help?

Building a new world is a colossal effort. You can help us with almost any skill set. There are apps to build, art to publish, docs to be written and most importantly people to educate.

You can help us grow together. One conversation at a time.
